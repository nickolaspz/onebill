# Contributing to uri-template #

Contribution is pretty easy. Simply fork and clone the repository and run the
following from the command line:

    bin/composer install --dev

This will download and install PHPUnit for you. At this point you can write
your test and then make your code change. No code changes will be accepted
without a corresponding test!
